## Description

The ColorBerry is based on the [Beepy by SQFMI](../inactive-projects/beepy.md), maintaining the same form factor while adding new features. Most notably, the ColorBerry has an 8-color JDI display with a backlightâ€”replacing the Beepy's black-and-white Sharp display, while maintaining the same dimensions and pixel count. ColorBerry also adds support for the Orange Pi Zero 2 W single-board computer, which is more powerful with higher power consumption than the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The ColorBerry is also available with a larger battery than the Beepy (5000 mAh instead of 2000 mAh). And the charging circuit is upgraded, enabling much faster battery charging than the original Beepy.

The drivers required for the JDI display are closed source: they are developed by Alex and published as binaries. These drivers are working well out of the box, with no significant problems reported on the Discord channel. But future updates to these drivers are dependent on the efforts of a single developer. This closes off the possibility that new developers could "pick up the torch" and continue development in the future, as has happened with lots of software developed for the original Beepy.
